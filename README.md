# pke-starling-controllers
If you wanna use this you need to install `epicallypowerful` and my own little side project `starling`. It's basically ROS without ROS, and it has threadbare documentation right now so good luck :).

```console
# clone epicallypowerful
cd epicallypowerful
pip install -e .
pip install git+https://github.com/siddn/starling.git
```
